ðŸ“Œ Project Summary
In this project, we worked as a team to design and implement a relational database for a Bookstore using MySQL.
The database includes key entities like books, authors, customers, addresses, orders, and shipping methods. Our goal was to build a system that stores data efficiently, enforces integrity using relationships, and supports queries that provide business insights.

The database is designed for:
Efficient storage and retrieval
Accurate tracking of customer orders and shipments
Author and book mapping
Multi-address support for customers
Secure access based on user roles

Tools Used:
MySQL â€“ For all database setup and data manipulation.
Draw.io â€“ For creating the ERD diagram.
GitHub â€“ For version control and collaboration.
